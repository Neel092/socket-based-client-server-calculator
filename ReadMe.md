# 🧮 Client-Server Calculator (C)

## 🚀 Overview

A modular client-server calculator built in C using socket programming.  
Now supports **concurrent multi-client handling** using a **Thread-per-Client model**, allowing multiple users to interact with the server simultaneously.

---

## 🧠 Features

- TCP-based Client-Server communication  
- 🧵 Thread-per-Client concurrency model  
- Multiple clients handled simultaneously  
- Expression parsing and evaluation  
- File-based input processing  
- Interactive keyboard input (getch-based)  
- Modular architecture (Parser, Calculator, Networking)  

---

## 🧵 Thread-per-Client Architecture

### 🧠 Idea
Each client connection is handled in a **separate thread**, enabling parallel communication.


---

### ⚙️ How It Works

**Main Thread:**
- Accepts incoming client connections  
- Creates a new thread for each client  

**Worker Thread:**
- Handles full communication lifecycle  
- Reads input → processes → sends response  
- Closes connection independently
